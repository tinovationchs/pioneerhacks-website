  <FaqItem q="What are the team requirements?">
    Teams may be anywhere from 1 to 4 people, though we highly suggest you work in a team rather than working solo. Additionally, feel free
    to come with your friends and form a team ahead of time. If you don't have a team by event day, that's okay too! We'll hold a team mixer
    for anyone still needing a team at the beginning of the event.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem q="Does this cost money?">
    Nope. PioneerHacks always has been, and will always be, completely free. Food, Wi-Fi, and all swag is provided free of charge thanks 
    to our generous sponsors and donors—just show up and be ready to make something awesome!
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem q="Is there a code of conduct?">
    Yes. All hackers are expected to follow the Code of Conduct that can be found on the Devpost page for this event. The Code is subject
    to change at any time.
    <br><br>
    Additionally, this event has event-specific rules that can also be found on the Devpost. By particpating in PioneerHacks, you are bound 
    by those rules. Rules are subject to change at any time.

  <FaqItem q="Do you offer travel reimbursements?">
    This hackathon is primarily intended for those living around the San Francisco Bay Area—but travel reimbursements may potentially be available
    on a case-by-case basis. Please reach out to us by email and we can discuss the details.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem q="What should I bring?">
    You should bring a laptop, phone, chargers, a student ID, toiletries, a sleeping bag, and
    any other accessories that you might need for your project. We’ll provide food, but it’s
    always a good idea to bring snacks in case you’re feeling hungry!
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem q="What if I have dietary restrictions?">
    Be sure to report those restrictions on the Registration Form—we will try our best to accomodate food options to you. However, we cannot
    guarantee that such accomodations will be made, so you are allowed and encouraged to bring your own meals if you believe this will be a serious concern.
  </FaqItem>
  <FaqItem q="What if I can't code?">
    No worries! PioneerHacks is open to programmers of all experience levels—from total beginners to advanced coders. 
    What matters most isn’t your previous experience, but rather your interest in technology and your passion for creating something cool!
    There will be plenty of mentors and workshops available to help you out with your project, and those with no experience will be eligible
    to compete in the Beginner division!
